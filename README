Net-BitTorrent-LibBTT version 0.018
===================================

mod_bt is a BitTorrent tracker for the Apache Web server.
It is written in C and runs as an Apache 2.x module.
It is possible for mod_perl or PHP to directly access the tracker's
information; no need to download and bdecode scrape URLs. The tracker
is fully configured from within Apache's own configuration file. The
goal of mod_bt is to seamlessly integrate Bram Cohen's BitTorrent protocol
with Apache so that any Webmaster who serves up large files can shift the
burden of bandwidth onto its clients with as little hassle as possible.
